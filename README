This is a quick mode for editing Nginx config files, as I didn't find
anything else around that did quite this much.

Many thanks to the authors of puppet-mode.el, from where I found a
useful indentation function that I've modified to suit this situation.

Syntax highlighting is currently rather(!) basic, but I'll extend it
as necessary.

Cheers,
 Cos.
